Foundry System for Five Parsecs from Home

## Wot's all this then?

This is the shell for a FoundryVTT system to play *Five Parsecs from Home*, a solo/duo procedurally generated wargame from Modiphius Entertainment. The initial pass on the system will be low-automation, getting the basic dice rolling functions, items and characters (actors, in Foundry VTT parlance) working at a basic level. 

I intend to leave openings for increased automation of the game regarding the procedural generation steps for each campaign turn, and resolution of combat, but the first step is getting a basic framework established.

## Status

As you can see, this is just a basic shell. There's no code, no sheets, nothing yet except the data template and some stubs.
